# FuelWise-App
Final year project application where a hybrid fuel app was created using APIs and had a sign up/log in page embedded. Also included a review section which was linked to firebase. The code for this application was written using the language JAVA. A dummy analytics page was also incorporated into the app so users can see fuel price trends.
